# Minimum-Distances-algo
The code finds the minimum distance between equal elements in the list by storing the last seen index of each value in a dictionary. Each time a repeated value is found, it calculates the distance to the previous occurrence and updates the minimum distance, returning -1 if no duplicates exist.
